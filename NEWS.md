November 2011 (Version 4):

* San Bernardino Valley: A new San Bernardino Valley basement is based on recent 
USGS inversion of gravity data confirmed by comparison to a seismic reflection 
line. The new model features a deep trough in the central valley, in contrast 
to the previous flat-bottomed valley model. The new basement joins smoothly to 
the relatively shallow Chino basin to the west.

* Salton Trough: A new model is motivated by the needs of TeraShake simulations 
of southern San Andreas fault events. Depth to basement is defined by a 
combination of seismic refraction surveys, inversion of gravity observations, 
surface geology, and boreholes. Sediment velocity-depth gradients depend on 
the nature of the basement, smoothing merging into deep metasedimentary 
basement, and having a discontinuity above shallow crystalline basement. The 
model includes the portion of the Trough south of the international border.

* Vp-density: The new Vp-density relation is based on density measurements 
from oil well samples in the Los Angeles basin and the San Gabriel Valley, 
geotechnical boreholes throughout southern California, and 12 oil wells along 
the LARSE lines. The newly determined Vp-density ratio is constant, in contrast
to the old relation. This is true even for low Vp, as defined by the 
geotechnical data. The new densities are higher, for a given Vp, than the old. 
This will tend to lower the Poisson ratio, which will lower Vp/Vs; that is, 
changing the Vp-density relation produces a new Vs model.
